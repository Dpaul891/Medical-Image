## 1. Data

- Due to the size limitation of bb, all the data are removed. You can download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/metadata.
- We have done some pre-processing to the raw data, please refer to the files like "./deeplabv3/Origin2VOC.ipynb", "./unet/compute_mean_std.py", "create_anno.py", etc. Besides, we may change the directory's names and structures of the daatset,  so please pay attention to this if you want to run the code.

## 2. Model_weight

- Due to the size limitation of bb, we have removed the model weights trained by the models. If you just want to run the "predict.py", please contact us to afford you the model weights. Or, you can train the model by yourself.

## 3. Software

Due to the large size of model weights, the software is somehow large. Thus, we choose to upload it to the BaiduYun instead of bb. The BaiduYun address will be released later.

## Remark

- If you have any problem, you can contact us by the email address in the report. 
- All the model weights and software will be uploaded to BaiduYun later and the address will be released if needed.
